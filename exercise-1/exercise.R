# Exercise-1
# Implement code from this book chapter: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html

# Packages
# install.packages('modelr')
# install.packages('tidyverse')
# install.packages('gapminder')
library(gapminder)
library(modelr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

# Initial view of the data with ggplot
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, group = country)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 1/3)


# Look only at new zealand
nz <- filter(gapminder, country == "New Zealand")
nz %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Full data = ")

nz_mod <- lm(lifeExp ~ year, data = nz)
nz %>% 
  add_predictions(nz_mod) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, pred)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Linear trend + ")

nz %>% 
  add_residuals(nz_mod) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, resid)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "white", size = 3) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Remaining pattern")



# Better yet, write your own function to accept a country as a parameter,
# and produce the same graphics



# Nest the data by country/continent
by_country <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country, continent) %>% 
  nest()


# Define a statistical model, and store it in a function



# Use the `map` functionality to run the same model for each country separately


# Add additional columns to store your residuals (distance between data and prediction)


# Unnest your residual


# Plot the residuals



# Plot residuals by continent


# Use `glance` to look at model quality


# Compare model quality to continent


# View country that have an r.squared value of less than .25
